# Predictive Analytics for Floods in Bangladesh: A Comparative Exploration of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Classifiers

This repository contains code and resources for the research paper titled "Predictive Analytics for Floods in Bangladesh: A Comparative Exploration of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Classifiers," presented at the 2023 26th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this research work is available at [Flood Prediction Dataset](https://github.com/n-gauhar/Flood-prediction). It contains historical weather data and flood occurrence information, crucial for training predictive models for flood prediction.

## Code

You can find the code for loading the dataset, conducting analysis, and running predictive models in the `code` directory of this repository. The code is organized and documented to facilitate easy understanding and reproduction of the experiments conducted in the paper.

## Models Explored

Several machine learning and deep learning classifiers were explored in this research, including:

- TabNet
- TabPFN
- LightGBM
- RandomForestClassifier
- LogisticRegression
- XGBClassiﬁer
- AdaBoost
- ExtraTreesClassiﬁer
